# Kali-Pi

This repo contains information on how to setup Kali Linux on a Raspberry Pi computer and hopefully make it one hell of a drop box...

- Start with [initial_setup.md](https://github.com/sn0wfa11/Kali-Pi/blob/master/initial_setup.md)
- Add an encrypted patition **(Highly Recomended)**: [secure_storage.md](https://github.com/sn0wfa11/Kali-Pi/blob/master/secure_storage.md)

More information to come!
