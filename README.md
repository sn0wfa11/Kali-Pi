# Kali-Pi

This repo contains information on how to setup Kali Linux on a Raspberry Pi computer. The goal here is to create a drop box that pentesters can drop behind firewalls to gain access to internal networks. These test both physical security and internal network security. 

The instructions and the scripts in this repo will walk you through setting up your own Kali-Pi drop box that will connect back to you automatically when plugged into power and an internet connection.

## Getting Started
First you will need to aquire a few things.
- Raspberry Pi 3 Model B - [$34.99 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Model-1-2GHz-64-bit-quad-core/dp/B01CD5VC92/ref=lp_5811495011_1_1?srs=5811495011&ie=UTF8&qid=1505689002&sr=8-1)

- Start with [initial_setup.md](https://github.com/sn0wfa11/Kali-Pi/blob/master/initial_setup.md)
- Add an encrypted patition **(Highly Recomended)**: [secure_storage.md](https://github.com/sn0wfa11/Kali-Pi/blob/master/secure_storage.md)
